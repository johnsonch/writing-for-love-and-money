![full](images/GettyImages-157634155.jpg)

##and help your reader level up

![full](images/GettyImages-170882047.jpg)


---
#What do you want the reader to learn,
##and how will learning this make them better?


^ Gather some points in a list

---
#Define your thesis

Modern web development takes more than just HTML and CSS with a little JavaScript mixed in. Clients want more responsive sites with faster interfaces that work on multiple devices, and you need the latest tools and techniques to make that happen. This book gives you more than 40 concise, tried-and-true solutions to today’s web development problems, and introduces new workflows that will expand your skillset.

^ Once you know who your reader will be, what level to address them at and what
you want them to learn. You can define your thesis.  This is what you should use 
to help guide decisions you make while writing.

---
#Outline your writing

```
- Eye Candy Recipes
	- Styling Buttons and Links
	- Styling Quotes with CSS
	- Creating Animations With CSS3 Transformations
	- Creating Interactive Slideshows with jQuery
	- Creating and Styling Inline Help Dialogs
- Testing Recipes
	- Debugging Javascript
	- Tracking User Activity with Heatmaps
	- Browser Testing With Selenium
	- Cucumber-driven Selenium Testing 
	- Testing JavaScript with Jasmine
```

^ A good outline is like a napkin sketch, put enough thought into it to guide
your path. Don't write the whole book on a napkin.


---
#Market Research

```
- What books out there are similar to yours?
- Why would yours be different?
- What is your audience size?
- How many of them would buy a book on the topic?
- What other books would have similar sales numbers to yours?
```

![full](images/GettyImages-sb10065595aj-006.jpg)

^ This is something that can be overlooked, but also don't worry about not pursuing
an idea you have just cause there is another book out there on the topic your
experiences will be different than theirs

---
#Your first chapter
##don’t start with an introduction!

---
#What is the most exciting part?
##Write about that first

![full](images/IMG_5283.jpg)

---
#Write about code

The best books about code talk more about the why than the how.

Don’t just explain the code. 

Explain why the code you’re demonstrating is the best solution.

![full](images/GettyImages-EC1887-001.jpg)

#Avoid appeal to authority

To the reader you are the expert, use your experience not someone else's

##Don’t be funny if you’re not

![full](images/GettyImages-873312-001.jpg)

---
#Beware of emulation

Don’t write like you think you should write or how you see others write

![full](images/GettyImages-475147931.jpg)

---
#Say more with less

- "Utilize" should be "Use"
- "At this point in time" should be "Now"
- "What x does is...",  just tell us already!
- Remove words like: that, went, honestly, absolutly, very, really, amazing, always, never, literly, just, maybe, stuff, things and irregardless
