through from Novice to Expert

---

---

---
#Learn about this model
##and help your reader level up

![full](images/GettyImages-170882047.jpg)


---
#What do you want the reader to learn,
##and how will learning this make them better?


^ Gather some points in a list

---
#Define your thesis


```
Modern web development takes more than just HTML and CSS with a little JavaScript 
mixed in. Clients want more responsive sites with faster interfaces that work on 
multiple devices, and you need the latest tools and techniques to make that 
happen. This book gives you more than 40 concise, tried-and-true solutions to 
today’s web development problems, and introduces new workflows that will expand 
your skillset.
```

^ Once you know who your reader will be, what level to address them at and what
you want them to learn. You can define your thesis.  This is what you should use 
to help guide decisions you make while writing.

---
#Outline your writing

```
- Eye Candy Recipes
	- Styling Buttons and Links
	- Styling Quotes with CSS
	- Creating Animations With CSS3 Transformations
	- Creating Interactive Slideshows with jQuery
	- Creating and Styling Inline Help Dialogs
- Testing Recipes
	- Debugging Javascript
	- Tracking User Activity with Heatmaps
	- Browser Testing With Selenium
	- Cucumber-driven Selenium Testing 
	- Testing JavaScript with Jasmine
```

^ A good outline is like a napkin sketch, put enough thought into it to guide
your path. Don't write the whole book on a napkin.


---
#Market Research

```
- What books out there are similar to yours?
- Why would yours be different?
- What is your audience size?
- How many of them would buy a book on the topic?
- What other books would have similar sales numbers to yours?
```

![full](images/GettyImages-sb10065595aj-006.jpg)

^ This is something that can be overlooked, but also don't worry about not pursuing
an idea you have just cause there is another book out there on the topic your
experiences will be different than theirs

---
#Your first chapter
##don’t start with an introduction!

---
#What is the most exciting part?
##Write about that first

![full](images/IMG_5283.jpg)

---
#Write about code

The best books about code talk more about the why than the how.

Don’t just explain the code. 

Explain why the code you’re demonstrating is the best solution.

#Avoid appeal to authority

To the reader you are the expert, use your experience not someone else's

#How to succeed

---
#Write Everyday

---
#750words.com

---
#Voice
##Setting the tone

---
#Be yourself
##Don’t be funny if you’re not

---
#Beware of emulation
##Don’t write like you think you should write or how you see others write

---
#Say more with less

* "Utilize" should be "Use"
* "At this point in time" should be "Now"
* "What x does is..." - just tell us already!
* "really", "very", "quite", "severely" don’t emphasize things as much as you think they do. Look for them, remove them, and see if you like how it looks.

#Let’s get published

#Finding a publisher vs Self Publishing

---
#Self Publishing
##Going Han Style...

---
#Can you ...

* write a concise book that meets the needs of your reader, reasonably free of errors?
* get an unbiased opinion of your work?
* deliver your book in print form to those that want it?
* deliver your book in PDF, ePub, or Kindle format in a way that actually looks good across multiple platforms and devices?
* be willing to promote the hell out of your book through web sites, user groups, communities, trade shows, etc?

---
#Of course you can
##But can you allocate enough hours to this?

---

---
#The Advance

If your book doesn’t sell, you did a years’ worth of work for $10,000

---
#Buybacks

Publishers have to buy back your books from retailers if they don’t sell

---
#Finding a publisher

* Start with a publisher you respect. 
* Each publisher has a different process, but most publishers have acquisitions editors that work to find authors for topics.
